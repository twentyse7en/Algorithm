# Time Complexity

This is really important As we can guess the expected time complexities,
so we can make decision on what to implement.

-   If n ≤ 12, the time complexity can be O(n!).
-   If n ≤ 25, the time complexity can be O(2n).
-   If n ≤ 100, the time complexity can be O(n4).
-   If n ≤ 500, the time complexity can be O(n3).
-   If n ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>, the time complexity can be O(n2).
-   If n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>, the time complexity can be O(n log n).
-   If n ≤ 10<sup>8</sup>, the time complexity can be O(n).
-   If n > 10<sup>8</sup>, the time complexity can be O(log n) or O(1).
