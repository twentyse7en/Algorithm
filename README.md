Algorithm are necessary as a software engineering and notes are especially handy for programming interviews.
I used to take the notes in a physical notes, which might get lost or I'm super lazy to pick that up. That 
is the reason why I put up a repo so I can write notes, store them permanently and access it from anywhere 
and don't start from scracth.
